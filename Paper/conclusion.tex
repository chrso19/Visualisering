The goal of this project was to create a tool that would be useful for foragers, both beginners and experienced.
The resulting dashboard has met this goal in a user-friendly and visually appealing way.
The dashboard has also been constructed using the Information Seeking Mantra and with considerations being made for those that are colorblind.
There are still possible improvements that could be made, either to expand the scope of the map or to enhance the user experience.
