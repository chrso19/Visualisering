The dataset used in this work was obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) \cite{gbif2026}.
We extracted observations for a list of edible species, using geographic coordinates and dates to map occurrences.
Each record contains additional metadata, such as observer, institution, and occurrence details. 
These metadata could be incorporated in future iterations to enhance the dashboard.
This structured dataset provides a reliable foundation for analysis and visualization while allowing for further expansion and refinement over time.
