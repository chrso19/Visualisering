The dataset used in this work was obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) \cite{gbif2026}.
We extracted observations for a list of edible species, using geographic coordinates and dates to map occurrences \cite{gbif_doi}.
The observation period spans from 1 January 2023 to 16 November 2025. Observations within this interval were extracted for the present analysis. 
This time window may be adjusted in future implementations, for example by updating the database on a daily basis.
The list of edible species was created using information from Naturstyrelsen \cite{naturstyrelsen2026}. 
All species in our list were manually categorized into eight groups: Herb, Fungi, Flower, Berry, Root, Algae, Nut, and Fruit.
Each record contains additional metadata, such as observer, institution, and occurrence details. 
These metadata could be incorporated in future iterations to enhance the dashboard.
As part of the data cleaning process, only observations distributed under licenses permitting reuse were retained.
This structured dataset provides a reliable foundation for analysis and visualization while allowing for further expansion and refinement over time.
