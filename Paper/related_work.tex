Existing platforms address related aspects of mapping edible or biological species.
iNaturalist provides a large database based on user submissions, but is not focused on edible species \cite{inaturalist2026}.
Falling Fruit also relies on user-submitted data and targets urban harvesting, but offers limited coverage in Denmark and includes non-relevant entries such as trash containers \cite{fallingfruit2026}.
VILD MAD focuses explicitly on edible species and is tailored to a Danish audience, but is available only as a mobile app and provides limited transparency regarding its underlying data sources \cite{vildmad_app2026}.
Our work focuses on creating an easy-to-use dashboard centered on edible species, intended primarily as a planning tool for foraging.
