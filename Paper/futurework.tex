While the dashboard works as intended and contains the elements, we wanted, there is still room for improvement.
One potential improvement would be to include a feature to select one's favorite species, so it is not necessary to make the same selection each time.
It would also be useful for the users to share the mini map, enabling access to the information, while being out foraging.
Since the dashboard is targeted at both novices and experienced foragers, it would also be convenient to include information on any poisonous species that look like the species being foraged for,
as well as guidance on pests such as ticks or mosquitos. 
The foraging map could also be expanded further to include fishing or hunting grounds, which would enable users to become even more self-sufficient.
Finally, conducting user testing and collecting feedback from users could help validate design choices and identify improvements to the interface.
