While the dashboard works as intended and contains the elements, we wanted, there is still room for improvement.
One such improvement would be to include a feature to select one's favorite species, so it is not necessary to make the same selection each time.
It would also be useful to the user to have the option of sharing the mini map, so it is possible to have that information, while being out foraging.
Since the dashboard is targeted at both novices and experienced foragers, it would also be convenient to include information on any poisonous species that look like the species being foraged for.
Or including any information about pests such as ticks or mosquitos. 
The foraging map could also be expanded further to include fishing or hunting grounds, which would enable users to become even more self-sufficient.
Finally, conducting user testing and collecting feedback from users could help validate design choices and identify improvements to the interface.
