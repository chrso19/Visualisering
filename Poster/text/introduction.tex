With the world becoming more digital, finding activities to encourage people to spend more time outside is increasingly important. 
One such activity is foraging. Foraging is not only a means to encourage people to spend time outside, 
but also a means to save money on groceries, forge stronger bonds across generations and has been linked to better health. 
To assist people’s foraging habits, we set out to build an interactive map that can provide an overview of which edible plant 
species are present across Denmark.
