Observations for a curated list of edible species were sourced from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), covering the period from January 2023 to November 2025.
Species were manually classified into eight categories (see filters in Figure \ref{fig:filter}). 
The data cleaning process retained only records with open licenses and valid geographic coordinates for use in the final visualization.
