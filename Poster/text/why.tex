The purpose of the dashboard is to support exploratory discovery of edible plant observations in Denmark.
The visualization is needed to give insights into trends and distributions that cannot be identified using a table alone.
The dashboard supports several actions and targets:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Users \textbf{discover} spatial \textbf{features} to gain an overview of where observations are concentrated.
    \item Users \textbf{compare the distribution} of plant categories across time period.
    \item Users \textbf{summarize the distribution} of plant observations across Denmark.
    \item Users \textbf{locate attributes} when plant species are known but their location is unknown.
    \item Users \textbf{browse the distribution of plant observations} within a selected region when species are unknown.
\end{itemize}
