The dashboard uses multiple visualization encodings to represent the data at different levels.

Marks
\item Area marks (hexagons) to represent aggregated spatial regions
\item Point marks to represent individual observations in the Minimap
\item Line marks to represent aggregated temporal data in the Observation Period


Channels
\item Position encodes geographic location (map) 
\item Color Luminance encodes observation density using sequential color scale
\item Color Hue encodes plant categories (categorical)

Manipulate: Users can select hexagonal regions and time periods to focus on a subset of the data.

Facet: The tool utilizes juxtaposition by uing spatial, temporal, and categorical views side by side.

Reduce: The data is reduced through:
\item Aggregation of observations
\item Filtering by time period, category, and species
